      Early albums consist of a cappella music. The band's first name was "Die
      Herzbuben", but it was changed to "Die Prinzen" in 1991 to avoid confusion
      with the Volkst√ºmliche Schlager duo Wildecker Herzbuben. The lyrics of
      their songs are often humorous, tongue-in-cheek critiques of German
      government or society. In reference to the group's
      name and the Brothers Grimm fairy-tale "The Frog Prince", the group's logo
      is a green frog wearing a crown.
